Increasing of processing and bandwidth -> Increasing invension of new tools


## A modern data ecosystem includes a whole network of
- Interconnected
- Indepandent
- Continually evolving entites


## The enterprise data environmet
<img src='./images/enterprise_data_environment.jpg' width='60%'> 

- Data integrated from disparate sources
- Different types of analysis skills to generate insights
- Stakeholders to collaborate and act on inside generated
- Tools, applications, and infrastructure to store process and diseminate data as required


__Steps__
1. Pull a copy of the data from the original sourcess into a data repository.
   The data source include: Structured, and Unstructured \
    **Challenge:** Relaibility, security, amd intgrity of the data
2. Raw data needs to get
    - Organised
    - Clean up
    - Optimized for access
    - Conform to compliance and standards enforced in the organisation
  
    **Challenge:** Data management, Repositories that provide high availability, flexibility, accessibility, and security.
3. Finally Users Business stakeholders, Application, Programmers / Analysts, Data Science use cases \
    pulling the data form data respositories \
    **Challenges:** Create Interfaces, APIs, Applications that can get the data to the end users with specific needs

## Emerging technologies shaping the modern data ecosystem

- Every enterprise today has access to limitless storage, high-performance computing, open source technologies, machine learning technologies, and the latest tools and libraries
- Data Scientists are creating predictive models by training machine learning algorithms on past data
- Big Data is paving the way for new tools and techniques and also new knowledge and insights
