1. Machine learning with scikit-learn
    * What is ML
    * Examples of ML
    * Unsupervised learning
    * Supervised learning
    * Types of supervised learning
    * Naming conventions
    * Before you use supervised learning
        - Requirement:
            - No missing values
            - Data in numeric format
            - Data store in pandas DF or NumPy arrays
        - Perform EDA first
    * Scikit-learn syntax

2. The classification challenge
    * Classifying labels of un seen data
    * k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    * KNN Intuition
    * Using scikit-learn to fit a classifier
    * Predicting on unlabeled data

3. Measuring model performance
    * Measuring model perfomance
        - For classification problem, `accuracy` is a commonly used metric.
    * Train test split
    * Model complexity
    * Model complexity and over/underfitting
    * Model complexity curve
